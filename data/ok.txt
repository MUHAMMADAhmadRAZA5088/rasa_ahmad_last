we care about
- availability
- location
- pricing


Question:

- Why we need slot_was_set bcz I wanna make a scenario in which if location isn't set in attempt want to store null otherwise the orignal do i need to do it using slots? because slot is already storing the location
- Do we need to store multiple type of scenarios because right now if i change the format then it doesn't pick the location from message
